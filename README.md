# ðŸ§  Project-Based Python

A set of real-world Python projects to apply and expand my skills.

These are based on the **Project-Based Python course from Pytopia**,  
with extra projects added along the way.

This repo follows my [Python Basics course](https://github.com/meowsawknee/my-python-journey)  
where I learned the core concepts and syntax.

## ðŸ—“ Milestone

Today marks **45 days** since I started learning Python.  
This repo begins the **"Project Phase"** of my journey.

## ðŸ§© About

Each project has its own folder and includes:

- Clean, readable code  
- A short README  
- CLI or Streamlit interface  
- Extra files (if needed)

This repository is here to sharpen my Python skills
