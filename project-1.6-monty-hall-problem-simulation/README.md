# 🚪 Monty Hall Problem Simulator

This project simulates the Monty Hall problem using both automatic simulation and manual play modes — built with Streamlit.

---

## 🌍 Context

This project was started before the war and the internet shutdown — and finished after the war.

> I don’t have the energy to polish it any further right now.  
> Let it stay like this for now. Maybe someday I’ll come back to it.

## 🧠 Reflection

Monty Hall was honestly mind-blowing.

I didn’t expect our brain to fail so badly on something like this.

I used to think: “Well, it's logical, once one door is removed, it must be 50-50.”  
But no — it's not.

This problem shows just how counterintuitive probability really is.
