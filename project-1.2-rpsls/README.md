# 🧠 Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock – The Sheldon Cooper Challenge

This is a Python-based terminal game inspired by the legendary Big Bang Theory episode – where **Sheldon Cooper** explains an expanded version of the classic *Rock, Paper, Scissors* game, featuring **Lizard** and **Spock**.

You play against Sheldon. First to score 5 points wins. But beware: Sheldon *doesn’t like to lose...*

## 🧪 About This Project

This version was built as a **pure function-based single-file game**, inspired by an exercise from the [Pytopia](https://pytopia.ai) course.

> We previously built an object-oriented, modular version of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors.  
> This version is a **deliberate contrast**, created to:
- Practice functional structure
- Focus on simplicity and ease of debugging
- Explore how even non-OOP code can stay clean and extendable

---

## 🎮 How to Play

```bash
python rpsls.py
```

You’ll be prompted to enter your name, and then pick one of these:
```
rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock
```

Each round:
- You play your move.
- Sheldon randomly plays his.
- The winner is decided.
- First to 5 points wins the game!

There's even a secret Easter egg command. Try typing `bazinga` 😉
